## Description:
This is a React-based E-commerce application that uses Commerce.js, an e-commerce API to manage products, cart and checkout. The API provides REST-based methods that help fetch, update and delete products and cart items. Checkout allows the user to enter shipping information and once the shipping country is entered, the respective shipping subdivisions and shipping options are pre-populated. Payments are handled through React Stripe.js, a thin wrapper around Stripe and Stripe Elements. Stripe is a library for building payment flows. See the [usage](#usage) or [demonstration](#demonstration) sections for a more detailed explanation on how to use this application.

User enters shipping address information and selects their shipping country from the 
drop down menu. Selecting a country prompts an api call to load a list of sub-divisions
of the respective country. The shipping options are also determined by the country selected
ie. whether the shipment will be domestic or international.

* __step 4:__

## Future Improvements:
* Use Redux to manage state instead of prop drilling data down several components.
* Allow user to add products from an add_product page, currently can only be done through a commerce.js account
* Use React.useMemo() so that child components don't have to re-render every time their respective parents do. This will further optimize performance.
